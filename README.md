# Hotel Network Design and Implementation

## Project Overview
This project designs and implements the network infrastructure for Vic Modern Hotel, spanning three floors with multiple departments. The network uses VLANs for segmentation, OSPF for dynamic routing, and DHCP for automatic IP assignment. Each department is placed in a dedicated VLAN, and wireless networks are set up for mobile devices. Routers, switches, and security features like SSH and port security are configured to ensure secure, scalable, and efficient communication across the hotel.

## Key Features
- **Three Routers** connecting each floor using serial DCE cables.
- **VLANs** per department for network segmentation.
- **DHCP** for dynamic IP address allocation across devices.
- **OSPF** routing protocol to advertise and manage routes between floors.
- **Wi-Fi Networks** on each floor for laptops and phones.
- **Port Security** on IT department switch to allow only Test-PC on port fa0/2.
- **SSH** enabled for secure remote router access.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Cisco Packet Tracer**: Used for network design and simulation.
- **VLAN, DHCP, OSPF**: Network segmentation, dynamic IP assignment, and routing.
- **SSH**: For secure router login.
- **Port Security**: Limits unauthorized device access.
